## 🚀 Rapfe-test

> A simple Python script to create and write to a test file — perfect for quick file I/O validation or project initialization.

This repository contains a minimal Python script (`Test.py`) that demonstrates basic file handling by creating a `.txt` file and writing two lines of text to it. While currently basic, it serves as a foundation for testing environments, learning Python file operations, or initializing quick proof-of-concept scripts.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Creates a text file programmatically  
- ✅ Writes multi-line content to file  
- ✅ Uses safe context manager (`with` statement)  
- ✅ Simple & self-contained — ideal for beginners or testing  

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

| Layer        | Technology |
|-------------|------------|
| Language    | Python 3.x |
| File I/O    | Built-in `open()` function |
| Environment | Any OS with Python installed |

---

## 📦 Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdeMm/Rapfe-test.git
cd Rapfe-test
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:
```bash
python3 --version
# or
python --version
```

No additional packages required — this script uses only Python’s standard library.

---

## ▶️ Usage Examples

Run the script directly from the terminal:
```bash
python Test.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
File created and written successfully.
```

**Result:**  
A new file named `test_file.txt` will be created in the same directory containing:
```
Hello, this is a test file!
This is the second line.
```

> 🔁 Re-running the script will overwrite `test_file.txt` (due to `"w"` mode). Modify to `"a"` for append behavior.

## 🗂️ Project Folder Structure

```
Rapfe-test/
│
├── Test.py           # Main script - creates and writes to test_file.txt
└── README.md         # This documentation file
```

> 💡 After running `Test.py`, expect:
> ```
> └── test_file.txt     # Generated output file
> ```

## 🔧 Configuration and Environment Variables

This project currently does **not** use environment variables or configuration files.

To customize behavior, edit `Test.py` directly:
- Change filename or path
- Switch from `"w"` (write) to `"a"` (append) mode
- Add dynamic content or user input

Example customization:
```python
filename = "custom_output.txt"
content = "Add any text here dynamically!"
```

## 🧪 Testing and CI/CD

Currently, there are no automated tests or CI/CD pipelines set up.

### ✅ Manual Testing
Run the script and verify:
1. Output message appears in console
2. `test_file.txt` is created
3. File contains expected content

### 🔄 Future Recommendations
Consider adding:
- A unit test using `unittest` or `pytest`
- GitHub Actions workflow for automation
- Linting with `flake8` or `black`

**Example GitHub Action idea:**
```yaml
name: Run Test Script
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Test.py
        run: python Test.py
      - name: Display Output
        run: cat test_file.txt
```
